\## Project Description

A fully responsive static website for a Fintech Dashboard, showcasing UI for financial services. It includes a hero banner, stats overview, feature cards, recent transaction cards, pricing plans, and a contact form. Built with semantic HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox for alignments, Grid for cards, media queries for responsiveness).



\## Features Implemented

\- Semantic structure: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>.

\- Responsive design: Mobile-first, with breakpoints at 768px (tablet: 2-column grids) and 1024px (desktop: 3-4 column grids).

\- Flexbox: Used in header, hero, footer, and CTA buttons.

\- CSS Grid: Used for stats, features, transactions, and pricing sections.

\- Visual polish: Google Fonts (Poppins), blue/orange color scheme, hover effects (scale/transform), transitions, and fade-in keyframe animation on sections.

\- Forms: Sign-up/contact form with labels, placeholders, required attributes.

\- Accessibility: Alt text for images, aria-labels, skip link.

\- Other: Navigation links, lists (in pricing), images (placeholders), consistent spacing.



\## Breakpoints and Layout Techniques

\- Mobile (≤767px): Single-column stacks, centered text.

\- Tablet (≥768px): Side-by-side hero, 2-column grids.

\- Desktop (≥1024px): Multi-column grids (e.g., 4 for stats), wider containers.

\- Techniques: Relative units (rem, %), CSS variables for colors/spacing, mobile-first media queries.
